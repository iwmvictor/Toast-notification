A simple JavaScript project that displays a toast notification when a button is clicked or any other event occurs. The toast notification provides a visual feedback to the user about the action performed.

## Technologies Used

## Features

- Responsive toast notification that appears at the top or bottom of the screen.
- Customizable message and duration of the toast notification.

- Additional hover effects for an enhanced user experience.

## Usage

1. Include the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

2. Create a button or any other element that triggers the toast notification.

```html
<button onclick="showToast()">Submit</button>
```

3. Initialize the toast notification in your JavaScript file.

```javascript
function showToast() {
  // Create a new toast notification
  const toast = new ToastNotification('Your message goes here', {
    position: 'top', // 'top' or 'bottom'
    duration: 3000 // Duration in milliseconds
  });

  // Show the toast notification
  toast.show();
}
